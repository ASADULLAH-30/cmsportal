<h3>ASAD ULLAH SHAIKH </h3>

<P>Hello, I'm Asad Ullah, currently pursuing Software Engineering at Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU). My passion lies in coding, and I've undertaken several significant projects to date. One of my notable works includes developing a heartbeat sensing device. Additionally, I created a resume builder using Python and Tkinter GUI, which generates resumes instantly with just a few inputs.

    Recently, I completed the first phase of a Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project. It involves compiling a comprehensive database of Pakistan Penal Law and implementing algorithms for crime search, providing detailed crime information, and legal pathways for complaints.
    
    Beyond academics, I have a keen interest in filmmaking and videography. I pursued a short course at NAVTTC in Iqra University and have actively contributed to documentary projects. Currently, I am gaining valuable experience as an editor through an internship at Art Council Karachi</P>
